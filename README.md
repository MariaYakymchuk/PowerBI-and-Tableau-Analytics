### Project Description: Analysis of Airport Performance in England

**Project Goal**

The goal of this project is to analyze the financial performance of 10 airports in England over three quarters using the provided dataset. The main objective is to create an interactive Power BI report to evaluate financial metrics and identify key trends affecting profitability and expenses.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Data Exploration
	•	Loaded the dataset and familiarized with its structure.
	•	Reviewed financial metrics (e.g., profit, expenses, revenue) for each airport and verified their format.
	•	Assessed data quality, checking for missing or anomalous values.

#### 2. Data Preparation
	•	Converted necessary fields into appropriate formats (e.g., date, numerical values).
	•	Added calculated columns for key performance metrics, such as: Profitability Expenses per Passenger

#### 3. Dashboard Creation in Power BI
		•	Key Metrics:
Added cards to provide an overview of total profit, number of flights, canceled flights, and passenger traffic for all airports.
	•	Passenger Traffic by Month:
A bar chart visualizing the number of passengers for each month.
	•	Profitability by Airport:
A horizontal bar chart showing profitability for each airport.
	•	Comparison of Profitability and Expenses by Month:
A line chart comparing profitability and expenses over the months.
	•	Profit vs. Expense Breakdown:
A donut chart representing the ratio of total profit to expenses.
	•	Interactive Filters:
Added dropdown slicers for selecting “Airport Name” and “Month.”
Configured the filters to apply across all dashboard elements for seamless interactivity.
